            <h3>Big data? Maybe?</h3>
            <p>What is big data? I still have an issue with truly grasping what it is. The term seems so inflated somehow, what makes data different from big data? Yes I get it, it's "bigger", but how much bigger? And is it nessesary for the data to be big,
                or does it just have to have a big impact?
            </p>
            <h4>HOME</h4>
            <p>There's a lot of questions to be answered, but I've recently been researching the topic. I've found a few good examples, like how the real estate agent HOME, used big data, for a clever marketing campaign. With data mined from other agents,
                they could know when to send potential customers, an offer to switch their realestate agent to home.
                <br>For more details, take a look at the video; It's quite clever!</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Gas pickup points in India</h4>
            <p>This other one, talks about how they found all sorts of funny small data-caches and made them work together, to find out where the best locations for gas pick up points in India were.</p>
            <div class="videoWrapper">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6WKt6fJiso" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>I must say, WOW, think about what kind of a difference, one can make with just the right amount of Data! I'm just really excited! </p>
            <p>All I can say is this, Big data is a big deal, it could be cool to learn even more about it.<br> But that might be for another time, later this year.</p>
            <p>For now I'll be focusing on improving my CSS skills, and after that, Javascript! </p>

            <h3>My journey begins</h3>
            <p>As with all things, you have to start somewhere. In my case, this site is where that is. </p>
            <p> I've just started on my journey towards the legendary title as Full Stack Developer. However, the road ahead is long. </p>
            <p> As you can see, this site only has the most rudementary HTML and CSS. I'm using JS for the under construction banner, but that's nothing to special.</p>
            <p>The fact of the matter is, that I've been working a lot to make this site, very nice looking, but that's also it. I'm learning as I go with the lynda.com "Learning path: Become a Full-Stack Web Developer", you can check it out <a href="https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Web/become-a-full-stack-web-developer">Here</a>                I still have around 50 hours of the playlist left, and as you can see I'm almost done with the CSS part of the courses. (Look how pretty it is :D )</p>
            <p>I'm really looking forward to start to play around with databases, apache server, PHP, Ruby on rails, Node.js, (let's take it one step at a time though!) </p>
            <p>That's it for my first (Hardcoded!!) blogpost. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
            <p>- Jonas</p>
