                <h3>Goodbye Facebook..</h3>
                <p >"Why?" - "I'll miss you!" - "What about planning for the reunion? :("</p>
                <p>That is just a small selection of the many comments I got, when I told my friends that I was quitting facebook. People couldn't really understand my motives, and to be honest, I'm not even sure as to why I, and yes I did do it, deleted my facebook account. This is me, trying to explain it, to you aswell as myself..</p>
                <h4>But why?</h4>
                <p>Let's be honest, facebook is a mixed bag; it's a practical platform for organizing events, coordinating with a study group, and a easy way to keep up with what your "friends" are doing.
                <p>But for some people, it gets addictive, endlessly just refreshing the facebook page, jumping in and out of it all the time - it's really bad. </p>
                <p>I guess I was one of those people, I liked the likes a little too much, the instant dopamine fix had me running circles. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't THAT addicted, I was just addicted as I guess many people are. The difference for me, was that I found out.</p>
                <h4>Addicted_</h4>
                <p>I'm a frequent YouTube viewer which in my opinion is WAY better than browsing the endless meaninglessness of Facebook.</p>
                <p>One day, I found a recorded livestream where Bryan Lunduke, a charming Linux enthusiast, sat down and straight up deleted his facebook account. Explaining all the great reasons he had to do so; Facebook was openly recording everything people did, said, browsed and liked, all the while made it addictive to use their site.</p>
                <div class="videoWrapper">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VEyvbgm_jBU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>That had me thinking.. </p>
                <p>There was a study done, on the relation between the amount of "likes" a person gave to posts etc, and the individuals happiness, the study found that, the more you used facebook, the more likely you would be to be unhappy.</p>
                <p> Ok, maybe it's not the whole picture, but get this; it's designed to be addictive, think about how you (how I) browse facebook, at some point you get numb, you feel like it's a waste of time. But every time you've been away from it for a while.. You instantly go back, in the need for some excitement, something to get the blood pumping. </p>
                <p>Next time, when you see that red circle with the number in it, at the notification icon, think about how that makes you feel, repeat after me; I am an addict.</p>
                <h4>Life after facebook_</h4>
                <p>Now think about what you would do if you didn't have a facebook? Can you imagine your life without it - no right?  That was for me the best reason to stop; the moment you truly believe that you can't live without something that redundant, seriously, IT'S FACEBOOK, it's hardly a basic human need.</p>
                <p>That was when it hit me; I didn't want to quit facebook, I HAD TO!</p>
                <p>It had me scared shitless; How would I keep up with birthdays? How would I make sure to still have friends after this, would they ever text me?</p>
                <p>The truth is short and simple: The real friends will stick around, the rest will dissappear, not because you dislike each other or anything, but because your "friendship" was not real all along.</p>
                <p>I don't have a grudge towards anybody but myself for this, believing that your facebook friends, somehow are your real friends, is believing in a lie, a big fat lie. In the end I was hoarder for facebook friends, I truly believed that having hundreds of superficial connections to people I hardly knew, somehow was going to make my life better.</p>
                <p>But just like in the tv show "Hoarders", the things - in this case my "friends" just ended up getting in the way, weighing me down, they created so much static in my brain. Event's I should be interested in, group chats with a 100 notifications an hour. Vacation, wedding and party photos giving me FOMO, groups with bantering and internet language, bringing out the worst in civilized people.</p>

                <h4>Relieved_</h4>
                <p>Just after I deleted my account, one of my housemates had his 2nd child, he had posted it on facebook - I didn't see it. Later that day, one of my other housemates told me the news. That was when I got relieved; I wouldn't miss out on the important stuff.</p>
                <p>I'm now on my.. well maybe 3rd day without facebook, and I'm perfectly happy, I don't know if I'm more or less productive. But there is one distinct difference, my life seems simpler, cleaner, it has less static.</p>
                <p>And that is worth world to me. And I wouldn't trade it for a million likes.</p>

                <h3>Big data? Maybe?</h3>
                <p>What is big data? I still have an issue with truly grasping what it is. The term seems so inflated somehow, what makes data different from big data? Yes I get it, it's "bigger", but how much bigger? And is it nessesary for the data to
                    be big, or does it just have to have a big impact?
                </p>
                <h4>HOME</h4>
                <p>There's a lot of questions to be answered, but I've recently been researching the topic. I've found a few good examples, like how the real estate agent HOME, used big data, for a clever marketing campaign. With data mined from other agents,
                    they could know when to send potential customers, an offer to switch their realestate agent to home.
                    <br>For more details, take a look at the video; It's quite clever!</p>

                <h4>Gas pickup points in India</h4>
                <p>This other one, talks about how they found all sorts of funny small data-caches and made them work together, to find out where the best locations for gas pick up points in India were.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I must say, WOW, think about what kind of a difference, one can make with just the right amount of Data! I'm just really excited! </p>
                <p>All I can say is this, Big data is a big deal, it could be cool to learn even more about it.<br> But that might be for another time, later this year.</p>
                <p>For now I'll be focusing on improving my CSS skills, and after that, Javascript! </p>

                <h3>My journey begins</h3>
                <p>As with all things, you have to start somewhere. In my case, this site is where that is. </p>
                <p> I've just started on my journey towards the legendary title as Full Stack Developer. However, the road ahead is long. </p>
                <p> As you can see, this site only has the most rudementary HTML and CSS. I'm using JS for the under construction banner, but that's nothing to special.</p>
                <p>The fact of the matter is, that I've been working a lot to make this site, very nice looking, but that's also it. I'm learning as I go with the lynda.com "Learning path: Become a Full-Stack Web Developer", you can check it out <a href="https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Web/become-a-full-stack-web-developer">Here</a>                    I still have around 50 hours of the playlist left, and as you can see I'm almost done with the CSS part of the courses. (Look how pretty it is :D )</p>
                <p>I'm really looking forward to start to play around with databases, apache server, PHP, Ruby on rails, Node.js, (let's take it one step at a time though!) </p>
                <p>That's it for my first (Hardcoded!!) blogpost. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
